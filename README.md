My [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) configuration file.

## Context ##
[Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is a higly custumizable, free, window managment app for Mac.

Previously I used [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/), before that [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/), but wanted a way to define window layouts and throw a window from one monitor to the other (for free).   
Found Slate on the comment section of some blog post, and spent an evening wrapping my head around the [documentation](https://github.com/jigish/slate/blob/master/README.md), trying to recreate the features that I used in both programs, plus a pair of pre-defined layouts.
